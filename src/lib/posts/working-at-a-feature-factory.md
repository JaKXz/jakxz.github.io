## Why

[John Cutler](https://cutlefish.substack.com/) wrote an excellent [follow-up](https://amplitude.com/blog/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-3-years-later) to his original thought provoking article, [12 Signs You’re Working in a Feature Factory](https://cutle.fish/blog/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory).
I've proposed a cool-down period to my current team because we've talked a lot about balancing building new things quickly and making time to revisit an ever growing backlog.
Wherever you and your team land, would you consider proposing something similar?
Please do share your experience below!

<Callout>
The cool-down sprint described below is adapted from: <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/2.2-chapter-08#cool-down">https://basecamp.com/shapeup/2.2-chapter-08#cool-down</a>

Note: the Shape Up authoring team works in six week cycles that they define in great detail in the Shape Up book, as well as all the other specifics of their process.
Your team probably has its own version of that, so **the focus of this memo is proposing the “cycle follow-up” / “cool-down sprint” motion.**

## What

If we run [six-week] cycles / projects back to back, there isn’t any time to think about what’s next.
The end of a cycle is the worst time to meet and plan the next project because everybody is too busy tying up loose ends and making last-minute decisions in order to ship on time.

Therefore, after each [six-week] cycle / project, we must schedule two weeks for cool-down.
This is a period with no scheduled work where we can breathe, discuss leftover work from the project, and consider what to do next.

After working hard to ship [six-week] projects developers and designers can use the two-week cool-down to fix bugs, revisit the backlog, explore new ideas, or try out new technical [possibilities](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/skin-shedding-code).
