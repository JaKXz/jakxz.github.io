This is a great book.
You should read it.

Here are my highlights from multiple reads.

## Introduction - the power of design thinking

### an end to old ideas

Speaking about Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the engineer who built the Great Western Railway:

> While considering the design of the system, he insisted upon the flattest possible gradient because he wanted passengers to have a sense of "floating across the countryside".

Not how I pictured Brunel at first; what a beautiful consideration that pushed us forward.

### we need new choices

> Design thinking relies on our ability to be intuitive, to recognize patterns, to construct ideas that have emotional meaning as well as functionality, to express ourselves in media other than words or symbols. Nobody wants to run an organization on feeling, intuition, and inspiration, but an overreliance on the rational and the analytical can be just as dangerous. The integrated approach at the core of the design process suggests a "third way."

### swimming upstream

> behind the soaring rhetoric of "genius" and "visionary" was a basic commitment to the principles of design thinking.

## Chapter One - getting under your skin; <br /> or <em>how design thinking is about more than style</em>
