If you're an early career software developer looking for a new role, you might find yourself in a highly competitive job market.
It can be challenging to stand out in a sea of applicants, but there are a few things you can do to improve your chances of landing your dream job.
This is not an exhaustive list, and there are many other resources out there as well.
I'll link some at the end of this post.

## Why should you listen to me?

- I've been a software developer for {new Date().getFullYear() - 2012} years, & the first ~3 were internships while I was in school
- I am a Staff level individual contributor & I've mentored >7 early career developers
- I've been on both sides of the interview table, totalling over 100 interviews

Firstly, don't underestimate the value of internships and intermediate experiences along the way.
It's out of the ordinary (but not impossible) to land at your dream company right away, so don't turn your nose up at other opportunities, especially when you need to build up real world experience and **demonstrate real world impact**.
If you're still a student or recent graduate, look for opportunities to gain practical experience by working as an intern.
Companies might hire interns on a temporary basis to fill in for full-time roles that they have posted, and if there isn't an internship role explicitly posted I don't think there's harm in asking about this.
This is a great way to get your foot in the door and build your professional network.

Another way to impress potential employers is to have a strong GitHub or public coding profile.
This means maintaining [relatively] well-organized projects with clear commit messages and best practices;
at least well enough so that you can explain them or draw from them quickly when presenting or telling a story about projects you worked on.
Consider writing useful tests that prove the behavior you're trying to create.
This will demonstrate your attention to detail, understanding the problem you're solving, and commitment to writing quality code.
Get involved in open source by being positive, supporting others, and contributing useful code to projects that you use.

You can improve your coding skills by learning about behaviour-driven development (BDD) and functional testing.
BDD is an approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration and communication between developers, designers, and business stakeholders.
It can help you write better tests and improve the quality of your code.
Check out this article on BDD and functional testing for more information.

Finally, make sure you have a solid understanding of computer science fundamentals.
In [good] interviews you'll be asked mid to high difficulty level questions;
while there might be pressure to finish, **they're really testing your ability to communicate: model/picture a problem, think about it critically, break it down into steps**, and _then [lastly, perhaps least importantly] turn that into a coded solution_.
To practice your coding skills, consider using online platforms like CodeSignal, which offer a range of exercises and tutorials on data structures and algorithms.

This post is adapted from advice I gave to someone who DM'd me on LinkedIn and asked some good specific questions;
they leveraged this advice and (I'm sure) the wisdom of others to begin a successful career.
Let me know what you think in the comments below;
this isn't a complete guide, as mentioned, but it's 3 really solid pillars to build on / start with.
