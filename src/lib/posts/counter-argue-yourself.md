excerpt: Practicing thorough explanations so you understand your own ideas
---

As a software developer, you often have to make decisions about the architecture, design, and implementation of your code.
These decisions are critical to the success of your project, but they are not always straightforward.
To make the best decisions, you need to be able to think critically and evaluate your own ideas.

This is why it's crucial to counter-argue yourself regularly.

One effective way to counter-argue yourself is to practice thorough, verbal explanations of your code.
When you are able to articulate your ideas in a clear and concise manner, you will be better equipped to evaluate them critically.

Counter-arguing yourself regularly can be a challenging task, but it's well worth the effort.
This practice will help you become more open-minded and receptive to other perspectives.
