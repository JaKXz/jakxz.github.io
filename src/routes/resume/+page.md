[Paddle HR](https://www.paddlehr.com) (acq. LinkedIn) | _Senior UX + Fullstack Developer_<br>
May **2019** - Aug **2020**

- Designed and led the implementation of robust & extensible JAMstack architecture and design system for Paddle's main product offering. A lot of care went in to the tools chosen [and avoided], and it paid off: functionality that's easy to define, structure, and fix with tests; consistent visual language and principles, and fast adoption of new technologies.
- Drove the adoption of GraphQL to easily build useful UIs on top of our 440MM+ pt dataset on career history and skills trajectories and derive useful insights for 30K+ enterprise users.
- Introduced thorough automated testing practices and code consistency for our Python codebases, resulting in faster and more reliable delivery.
- Supervised a Junior Developer and mentored them through daily processes and ad hoc projects helping them become a quickly contributing member of the team.
- Facilitated team retrospectives & pruned meetings leading to immediate & continuous improvement in our process and effectiveness of experiments.
- Reviewed several applicants and conducted personal and technical interviews. Received positive feedback from all applicants for the interview process and mentorship provided.
