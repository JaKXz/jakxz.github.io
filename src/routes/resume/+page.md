4. [Redux Utilities](https://github.com/redux-utilities), [flux-standard-action](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flux-standard-action), _500K+ monthly downloads_<br>
   Became a core maintainer after reaching out to the original author on the React core team and taking care of repository issues. Contributed architectural decisions and insights to the larger Redux Utilities org.

5. [stylelint-plugin-webpack](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/stylelint-webpack-plugin)<br>
