# What kind of work I want

This article is to help recruiters, hiring managers, and myself have a better idea of the kind of places I’d like to work.

The short version: A job where reliability and performance is important, at scale.
No gambling or otherwise predatory fintech. 
I value working remotely (no hybrid), DEI, emotionally healthy teams, and good management.

## Engineering

While I’ve built a lot of features, I’m most passionate about making existing systems faster and more reliable.
I love working at scale, and I care about how my services run in production.
Digging through code that gets run tens of thousands of times a second is an exciting responsibility.
I want to be on-call for the services I own, as long as I’m empowered to work on their reliability.

I want the set of services I own to be small enough that I can focus on them properly.
I think good engineering work requires maintaining a fair amount of context on the technical details of each project.

## Organization and culture

I want to work in a company mature enough to support me, but agile enough to allow me to own my service in production.
I’m not interested in a company where I have to file a ticket to (e.g.) view production logs.

I think good engineering work is done by teams.
While I do value good documentation, there’s no substitute for the context built up by working with other people on a technical problem.
I don’t want to work at a company that routinely hands off services to other teams or other engineers.

I want to work with engineers more junior than myself.
I enjoy mentoring and up-skilling other engineers, and I also believe that the presence of junior engineers forces teams to adopt healthier processes.

I want to work at a company that values DEI and supports a wide variety of cultures.
I don’t want to work with only people like myself, or at a place where I couldn’t in good conscience refer my engineer friends who aren’t young men.

I want to believe in the company’s mission & consider it morally neutral at the very least.

I want to work remotely;
I want to work at a company that prioritizes my pay and benefits over lavish offices and unnecessary expenditure & respects my autonomy and time to not force me to commute to sit somewhere else I'll have to join video calls anyway.
It's a huge plus if there are [quarterly / on a reasonable frequency] get-togethers to build bonds, shared experiences, and chemistry with my colleagues.

## Management

I want to work for a manager who values management skills.
Management is hard and requires focus on specific non-technical skills.
I've found that the best managers I've had are strong programmers in their own right which is the base for the empathy needed.

I want my manager to be keeping track of my career progression, and to be an active partner in helping me develop new skills and sell my skills to the wider organization.
I want my manager to actively communicate to me what the company cares about, and how I can find the best fit between my own values and what is currently needed by the org.

I think it’s important to have regular 1:1s with my manager, preferably weekly. It’s OK for these meetings to be short.
