## ðŸŽ’ Experience

[PaddleHR](https://www.paddlehr.com) (acq. LinkedIn) | _Senior Engineer & Front-end architect_<br>
May **2019** - Aug **2020**

- Designed and led the implementation of robust & extensible JAMstack architecture and design system for Paddle's main product offering. A lot of care went in to the tools chosen [and avoided], and it paid off: functionality that's easy to define, structure, and fix with tests; consistent visual language and principles, and fast adoption of new technologies.
- Drove the adoption of GraphQL to easily build useful UIs on top of our 440MM+ pt dataset on career history and skills trajectories and derive useful insights for 30K+ enterprise users.
- Introduced thorough automated testing practices and code consistency for our Python codebases, resulting in faster and more reliable delivery.
- Supervised a Junior Developer and mentored them through daily processes and ad hoc projects helping them become a quickly contributing member of the team.
- Facilitated team retrospectives & pruned meetings leading to immediate & continuous improvement in our process and effectiveness of experiments.
- Reviewed several applicants and conducted personal and technical interviews. Received positive feedback from all applicants for the interview process and mentorship provided. 

[Nulogy](http://nulogy.com) | _Intermediate Developer_<br>
Aug **2016** - Aug **2018**

- Co-invented and implemented [storybook driven development](https://medium.com/nulogy/storybook-driven-development-a3c517276c07) - a methodology for rapidly prototyping/developing visual components - with senior team members.
- Built a data-intensive dashboard serving millions of rows of data with PostgreSQL, Ruby on Rails, React, and Redux to help planners derive insights from historical data.
- Developed consistent component / container pattern for data deserialization and visualizations and shared language with the design team, work that led to the full-fledged [design system](https://nulogy.design/).

[Rangle.io](http://rangle.io) | _JS Developer_<br>
Oct **2015** - Apr **2016**

- Co-led [tooling & maintenance of OSS starter projects](https://github.com/rangle?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=starter&type=&language=), making new projects start up 2-5x faster & enabling the aggressive staffing model Rangle uses.
- Consolidated 2 internal products using Koa and React + Redux, managing large datasets from multiple scheduling APIs to set up future employee and company success.
