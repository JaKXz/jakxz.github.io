Since most developers spend more time reading code than writing it, practicing reading and reviewing code has multiplicative benefits;
soon you‚Äôll find yourself reviewing code as written here right in your editor.
This is one senior dev‚Äôs take among several others on the internet based on my own experience, usually being the one who leads the team in quantity and quality of reviews: <strong>your mileage may vary so help yourself to a few grains of salt üôÇ</strong> especially because I‚Äôm trying not to be too generic here but it‚Äôs inevitable.</p> <!> <p>I usually approach reviews based on the level of context I have with a codebase and how frequently I have to interact with it or take responsibility for it.</p> <ol><li>High context - you are actively working on this area of the codebase and you are familiar with the inner workings, tribal knowledge, and arcane hacks going on.</li> <li>In-between - you touch this code occasionally, enough to be able to make changes with some confidence; but, are not an expert.</li> <li>Low / outside your normal context - you may or may not be responsible for this area of the codebase, but you don‚Äôt work on it very much. Most of what you‚Äôre reading in this PR is new to you or vaguely familiar (product-wise) at best.</li></ol> <p>Here are some guidelines and questions you can ask yourself and the author(s) to provide a good review depending on how much context you have.
For each level of context, there are prompts to help you ask good questions; at each level these should guide you towards providing higher quality feedback.
You can mix and match as you see fit!</p> <h2 id="high-context"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#high-context"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>High context</h2> <ul><li>Acting as QA for your teammate is the best way to ‚Äúhave each other‚Äôs backs‚Äù - testing for and catching edge cases that the author may have missed is clutch. Good teammates will thank you.</li> <li>Product minded questions are crucial: <em>why</em> do we need this change? Can the desired behaviour be achieved with simpler or no code? Remember, less (no) code is best code.</li> <li>Ideally, PRs are relatively small (<code>+200/-200</code> lines changed at most excluding tests/fixtures etc); <ul><li>if not, can the PR be split up to introduce the change in steps? This might point out gaps in dependencies to the author.</li> <li>For the inevitably large MR, try to review commit by commit, and ideally commit messages are where most of the time bound context/documentation is.</li> <li>Or, review file by file, <em>going in order</em> from UI -> backend, or, backend out to UI. Can you trace the logic from your developer tools back to the server requests?</li></ul></li></ul> <h2 id="in-between"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#in-between"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>In-between</h2> <p>e.g. This might be a component library that you use but don‚Äôt modify often.</p> <ul><li>This change should further educate you on this area of the codebase. <ul><li>If not, ask for clarification. Requesting documentation via tests is a good place to start.</li> <li>Asking for comments might be a double-edged sword (since they can go out of date) - the best approach is to ask for a comment explaining <em>why</em> a complex section of code exists or is written the way it is, rather than <em>what</em> that code is doing.</li></ul></li> <li>Ideally, you spot / point out patterns that repeat or can be simplified to make the area of the codebase easier to understand.</li></ul> <h2 id="low-context"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#low-context"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Low context</h2> <p>e.g. A dependency bump or security request somewhere you‚Äôve been asked to provide eyes on.</p> <ul><li>Does a smoke test pass? Are you able to pull, build, and test the code locally? Anything strange in CI?</li> <li>Ask about ‚Äúgeneral best practices‚Äù e.g. usually an X project does Y, does that apply here? Why or why not?</li> <li>Can you articulate the <em>Why</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>What</em> of this change (rather than / don‚Äôt worry about specific details in the <em>How</em>) succinctly back to the author?</li></ul> <h2 id="what-about-general-etiquette"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-about-general-etiquette"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>What about general etiquette?</h2> <p>First, assume positive intent: past you or your colleague are not deliberately trying to lower the quality of the codebase.
Encourage continuous improvement over perfection.
Developers need to make progress; overly difficult reviews can discourage future improvements.</p> <p>With that in mind, ask these questions from a posture of learning and curiousity.
Easily applicable one-line suggestions help get the PR shipped sooner so don‚Äôt be shy about those!</p> <p>Finally, pick your battles!
Remember where you are in your product cycle: first make it work, then make it fast, <em>then</em> make it right.
Code review should support you and your teammates getting to this end.</p> <hr/> <p>What do you think? What did I miss? üëáüèΩ</p>`,1);function R(i){var e=m(),n=l(h(e),2);u(n,{children:(s,p)=>{var r=c();o(2),t(s,r)}}),o(34),t(i,e)}export{R as default,d as metadata};
