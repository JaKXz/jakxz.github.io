So if you’ve had to work with multiple node versions on one development machine, you may have had a hard time keeping both these worlds in sync.
Today I learned/pieced together a way to keep myself sane after dealing with node/npm permission issues for the last time.
This also has only been possible relatively recently (at time of writing) since <code>node@X</code> versions have only been recently published as <strong>keg-only</strong> formulae on <code>brew</code> (keg-only is important).`,v,x,J=`I have worked with <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm" rel="nofollow"><code>nvm</code></a> and <a href="https://npm.im/n" rel="nofollow"><code>n</code></a> and I don’t want to disparage either because they do work, and even work well at scale, but both have their flaws IMHO.

Tangentially (from my experience), this is another problem that has been solved relatively recently, since <code>npm@latest</code> has become much more stable across versions of node.`,E,H,Q=`Now, run the commands at the top of this article and you should be good to go!
