So if you’ve had to work with multiple node versions on one development machine, you may have had a hard time keeping both these worlds in sync.
Today I learned/pieced together a way to keep myself sane after dealing with node/npm permission issues for the last time.
This also has only been possible relatively recently (at time of writing) since <code>node@X</code> versions have only been recently published as <strong>keg-only</strong> formulae on <code>brew</code> (keg-only is important).</p> <p>I have worked with <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm" rel="nofollow"><code>nvm</code></a> and <a href="https://npm.im/n" rel="nofollow"><code>n</code></a> and I don’t want to disparage either because they do work, and even work well at scale, but both have their flaws IMHO.
Since <code>brew</code> manages all my packages for me, why not keep using it?</p> <h2 id="what-is-a-keg-only-formula"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-is-a-keg-only-formula"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>What is a <code>keg-only</code> formula?</h2> <!> <p>Essentially this means that you can have as many versions of node installed on your computer without them conflicting with each other, and as a bonus, your <code>npm</code> installation!
Tangentially (from my experience), this is another problem that has been solved relatively recently, since <code>npm@latest</code> has become much more stable across versions of node.</p> <p>Now, run the commands at the top of this article and you should be good to go!
Remember you will need to <code>export</code> your <code>$PATH</code> variable in every shell session you want to use a different version of node from the default version.</p> <p>If you want to set a different version of node as your default system version:</p> <pre class="language-bash"><!></pre> <hr/> <p>Originally published here: <a href="https://jakxz.svbtle.com/manage-node-versions-with-brew" rel="nofollow">https://jakxz.svbtle.com/manage-node-versions-with-brew</a></p>`,1);function S(h){var n=w(),e=o(g(n),2),p=r(e);c(p,()=>`<code class="language-bash">brew <span class="token function">install</span> <span class="token function">node</span> node@14 node@16 <span class="token comment"># latest, and all LTS versions at time of writing</span>
