As we were working on the updates to the app template in a separate branch from <code>main</code>, here’s what I suggested to those who wanted to test out our changes early:</p> <ol><li>Add <code>.diff</code> to the end of a github PR url</li> <li>Visit that link - copy the link you are redirected to</li> <li>Apply the changes via <code>curl</code> & <code>git</code>, e.g. for <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-node/pull/726.diff" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-node/pull/726.diff</a>:</li></ol> <pre class="language-sh"><!></pre> <p>Your mileage may vary with this especially if you re-arrange files differently than the original template repo, and of course it depends on the authors following “atomic PR” best practices.
Hopefully this is still useful to you to pull down upstream changes and to try to incorporate them in your local environment.
Good luck!</p> <hr> <p>Originally shared here: <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-node/issues/725#issuecomment-1062308480" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-node/issues/725#issuecomment-1062308480</a></p>`,1);function _(o){var e=u(),t=i(r(e),4),a=l(t);c(a,()=>`<code class="language-sh"><span class="token function">curl</span> https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/Shopify/shopify-app-node/pull/<span class="token operator">&lt;</span>PR number<span class="token operator">></span>.diff <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token function">git</span> apply
