So if you’ve had to work with multiple node versions on one development machine, you may have had a hard time keeping both these worlds in sync.
Today I learned/pieced together a way to keep myself sane after dealing with node/npm permission issues for the last time.

Tangentially (from my experience), this is another problem that has been solved relatively recently, since <code>npm@latest</code> has become much more stable across versions of node.`,A,g,U=`Now, run the commands at the top of this article and you should be good to go!
